# About

"CityPop" is an app written in React Native that does two main things. When the user starts the app, the user will land on the home screen where he or she can navigate to a search by city screen or a search by country screen. If the user navigates to the search by city screen and searches for a city, the user will be taken to a new screen where the name of the city and the size of its' population will be displayed. On the other hand, if the user navigates to the search by country screen and searches for a country the user will first be taken to a screen in which the name of the three biggest cities of that country are displayed, ordered by population size. The user can then press on one of the cities, and will then be taken to a new screen where the name of the city and the size of its' population is displayed.

## Instructions

3. Type the command "npm install". This might take a minute or two, which is fine. Just wait for the installation to finish. If you run into any errors, see if "npm install --force" does the trick. If this doesn't work, copy the error message, paste it into google and try to resolve it. 
4. Now type "expo start". A QR code should appear in the terminal.
5. Open up the App Store or Google Play, depending on whether you have an iPhone or Android device. 
6. Type "expo go" and download the app "Expo Go".
7. Once it is installed, scan the QR code that you can see in the terminal with the camera on your device. If this doesn't work an you are on Android, open up the Expo Go app and scan the QR code from there.
